### 2. Second Semester (Spring 2022)
   - In the second semester, our primary subject was **Computer Programming (CP)**, which was divided into two parts: theory and lab.
   - The course focused on **procedural programming in C++**, covering essential topics such as data types, conditional statements, loops, functions, pointers, and structures.
   - To delve into this semester's coursework, you can navigate to the following sections:
     - [CP Theory](./semester_2_(spring-22)/Computer%20Programming%20Theory/)
     - [CP Lab](./semester_2_(spring-22)/Computer%20Programming%20Lab)

### 3. Third Semester (Fall 2022)
   - In the third semester, our subject was **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, which also included both theory and lab components.
   - We learned **object-oriented programming concepts in C++**, covering topics such as classes, objects, constructors, data members, methods, inheritance, polymorphism, and operator overloading.
   - Explore my work for the third semester in the following sections:
     - [OOP Theory](./semester_3_(fall-22)/Object%20Oriented%20Programming%20Theory)
     - [OOP Lab](./semester_3_(fall-22)/Object%20Oriented%20Programming%20Lab)
